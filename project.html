										<h1>IT Project Idea</h1>
									</header>
                  <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
									<p>Appearing to be the next logical step in kitchen-technology innovation, the Smart Cupboard brings several new elements to the conventional cupboard. Designed for assisting those who are shorter, older, or simply want to upgrade to make life easier. It also is a nice statement piece for any kitchen that is lacking one.</p>
                  <h2>MOTIVATION</h2>
                  <p>The idea of the smart cupboard came to me when I realised that the cupboard has remained relatively the same for centuries. All the flaws with none of the innovation, it disappointed me. It’s about time we evolve and take the next big leap towards the future. Shorter individuals will no longer have to struggle to reach a high shelf, groceries and shopping lists made even more accessible, and moon phase activated x and y axis shelf rotation from within the cupboard. All these aspects together, paired with a sleek design, form the smart cupboard and can assist those who are shorter or elderly.</p>
                  <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
                  <p>-	A shelf that rotates on both the x and y axis based on time of day that can be altered by the user to fit their preferences. The food within the cupboard would be placed based on what meal it would correspond to.
-	Screen on the front of door that shows valuable information, such as a weather forecast, news or a calendar. These can help the user stay organised and informed.
-	The user can input a weekly shopping list into the in-built screen. The cupboard will make a record of these items and let the user know what needs to be purchased at the end of each week.
-	Alexa integration. Can ask if the cupboard contains a certain product or the availability of that product in nearby stores.
-	Ability to put recipes on the cupboard screen and tick off steps as you go through the recipe, perfect for its placement in the kitchen.
-	Layout can be customised by the user based on their preferences. This means they can shift around different aspects of the cupboard. This includes the adding or removing of specific features or changing the dimensions of the cupboard. As a result of this, each cupboard will be specifically tailored to the user’s choices.
-	Not only will the cupboard sort your cooking ingredients in whatever way you like, you can also put in an amount of any ingredient you need, and the cupboard will measure it for you using it’s built in tools. E.g. “Alexa, give me half a cup of flour.” The cupboard will note where the user has entered where they keep the flour and pour out ½ a cup for them.
-	You can design certain basic premade meals that the cupboard is able to cook. The potential of this feature may vary on the other features the user has picked. The power of this feature will obviously improve with time, however with current technology there would only be certain foods the cupboard is able to make, e.g. breakfast cereals or toasted sandwiches.
-	The cupboard also comes with a built-in timer to assist with cooking and other tasks that need to be performed.
-	Built in coffee machine with several different types that can be made. Uses a pod system to make the beverages.
-	App integration allows for control of aspects while out of the home via the user’s phone. E.g. making a coffee while on the way home so it’s done by the time you get home.
</p>
                <h2>TOOLS AND TECH</h2>
                <p>In order to design the smart cupboard, we would need integration with pre-existing services, such as amazons Alexa program. We would also need to use a version of android for the touch screen on the front of the cupboard that would be able to run the necessary programs for the cupboard’s specifications. We would need the right materials to build the cupboard to each user’s specifications, as well as trained and experienced carpenters to assemble them.</p>
                <h2>SKILLS REQUIRED</h2>
                <p>The skills required to make the cupboard would involve the programming of the core features such as the touch screen interface as well as working Alexa into the cupboard’s functions. On top of this the cupboard would also have to have special hardware engineered for the rotation of the shelves relative to the time and the movements needed to pour ingredients.</p>
                <h2>OUTCOME</h2>
                <p>If the project is successful, the cupboard would become a solution for the issue of shorter individuals not reaching the top shelf as well as being a statement piece for any kitchen. The cupboard’s many features will also make life even more simple for the individuals who chose to have one in their house. It will be especially important to the people who are interested in having a smart hoe / fully automated home.</p>
